          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>Harmful stereotypes of the queer community in media play a role in affecting the mental health of queer youth, persisting despite the growth in representation. Certain outlets continue to perpetuate harmful stereotypes, impacting the well-being of the queer community, especially among youth.</p>

          <h2>Need Statement</h2>
          <p>Queer youth need accurate and positive representation in media to combat harmful stereotypes, fostering a sense of belonging and boosting self-esteem. Accurate portrayals aim to help improve issues like alarming statistics on bullying and violence. This is essential for creating a supportive environment and improving the mental health of queer youth.</p>

          <p>"Two-thirds of LGBTQ youth faced attempts to change their sexual orientation, with 76% citing the political climate's impact on their mental health. Less than half were out to an adult at school, and 58% of transgender/nonbinary respondents reported discouragement from using gender-consistent bathrooms. The CDC's 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey revealed that 34% of LGBT youth experienced school bullying, 18% faced physical or dating violence, and the same percentage reported sexual assault. Additionally, approximately 1 in 10 faced threats or injuries with a weapon at school."</p>

          <p>"Even as they are increasingly welcomed by peers, their mental health is significantly worse than that of heterosexual young people. Many young transgender and gay people have been affected by a wave of recent Republican-led legislation questioning their identity or putting restrictions on their lives. They’re being raised by generations whose approval of and comfort with L.G.B.T.Q. identities lag their own. Even as social inclusion for young L.G.B.T.Q. people has grown, large health disparities between them and their non-L.G.B.T.Q. peers have not shrunk."</p>

          <p>"In 2019, the Pew Research Center reported that the general US population significantly changed their views of same-sex marriage in just 15 years—with 60% of the population being opposed in 2004 to 61% in favor in 2019. While there are many other factors that likely influenced these perspective shifts, studies suggest that positive LGBTQ media depictions played a significant role."</p>
