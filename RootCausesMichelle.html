      <p>Evidence: “Youths with more family and friend support experienced less depressive symptoms (r = -.26 and -.20, respectively). Friend support was related to fewer conduct problems (r = -.19), and family support was related to higher self-esteem (r = .26). Conversely, youths with more negative social relationships reported more anxious and depressive symptoms, more conduct problems, and lower self-esteem (r = .28, .30, .24, -.36, respectively). Youths who experienced gay-related stress reported more anxious symptoms (r = .17).”
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Explanation: Family rejection hits youth hard because family is a big deal for their health and growth. When parents reject them, it hurts their attachment, losing the safety of their family. This can lead to emotional struggles, isolation, and being unsure about getting close to friends and significant others.</p>

      <p>Evidence: “In a study of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths and their families, D'Augelli and Hershberger (1993) found that only 11% of these adolescents received positive parental responses after disclosing their sexual orientation to parents. A number of lesbian, gay, and bisexual adolescents are verbally and/or physically assaulted by family members because of their sexual ori-entation. Pilkington and D'Augelli (1995) found that over a third of their lesbian, gay, or bisexual youths had been verbally assaulted by a family member because of their sexual orientation. Ten percent of the adolescents in this sample had been physically assaulted by a family member. The extremely negative family relationships— those that involve abuse, neglect, or rejection —may result in adolescent homelessness and emotional and physical health risk (e.g., Rotheram-Borus et al., 1994; Savin-Williams, 1994b).”
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Explanation: The evidence highlights the crucial role of family factors in shaping the mental health outcomes of queer adolescents. Negative parental reactions, verbal and physical assaults, and overall hostile family environments contribute to emotional distress, potential homelessness, and increased health risks for this population.
