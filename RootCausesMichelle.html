        <div class="container text-left">

            <div class="col" style="background-color: rgb(224, 139, 154);">
              <h3>Root Cause #1</h3>
              Both individual (discrimination, lack of understanding) and systemic (limited LGBTQ+ affirming services, discriminatory practices) barriers in healthcare contribute to mental health challenges among queer individuals
            </div>
            <div class="col border" style="background-color: white;">
              Evidence #1: “A study conducted by The Association of Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals, and Transgenders Parade in Brazil...found that 67 % [of 846 LGBTQ+ members] had suffered discrimination because of homosexual orientation and that 59 % had experienced some type of physical violence…For some area workers, the LGBT population is a group of sick people, not worthy to formalize marriages and adopt children; by witnessing attitudes of affection between members of the group, the repulsion of these workers was awakened."
            </div>
            <div class="col border" style="background-color: white;">
              Explanation #1: The study in Brazil revealed that many LGBTQ+ individuals faced discrimination and violence. Some health professionals have biased views. These negative biases from healthcare workers can make queer people hesitant to seek medical help. When they do, the fear of judgment, shame, or mistreatment leads some to keep their sexual orientation secret. This impacts the quality of care received, leaving LGBTQ+ individuals dissatisfied and potentially neglecting their mental health needs. 
            </div>
            <div class="col border" style="background-color: white;">
              Evidence #2: “TRANS participants were 2.4 times as likely to report an unmet need for
mental healthcare than CIS-HET women. BI/PAN
women were 1.8 times as likely to report an unmet need for
mental health relative to CIS-HET women.”
            </div>
            <div class="col border" style="background-color: white;">
              Evidence #2: Trans individuals and bisexual/pansexual women are more likely to face unmet mental health needs compared to cisgender heterosexual women. This is because factors like discrimination, lack of social support, and exclusion from healthcare contribute to these challenges. Social factors, along with systemic issues, play a role in higher rates of untreated depression among trans and bisexual individuals.

            <div class="col border" style="background-color: white;">
              Implications for effective “solutions:" Create educational programs to increase awareness about diverse sexual orientations and gender identities. Promote inclusivity in schools and workplaces through training programs, safe spaces, and media representation. 
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row mt-4" style="background-color: white;">
            <div class="col" style="background-color: pink;">
              <h3>Root Cause #2</h3>
              Social Stigmas motivate a variety of low esteem and mental health factors in minority groups.
            </div>
            <div class="col border" style="background-color: white;">
              Evidence #1: “The minority person is likely to be subject to such conflicts because dominant culture, social structures, and norms do not typically reflect those of the minority group. An example of such a conflict between dominant and minority groups is the lack of social institutions akin to heterosexual marriage offering sanction for family life and intimacy of LGB persons.” 
            </div>
            <div class="col border" style="background-color: white;">
              Explanation #1: Social stigmas can negatively affect minority group’s self-esteem and mental well-being because they are perceived as “alien” from social structures and societal norms. Social stigmas cause the needs of minority groups (like the LGBTQ+ community) to be neglected. This conflict induces stress, alienation, and a sense of normlessness. The lack of recognition for diverse family structures and relationships further contributes to mental health challenges among the queer community.
            </div>
            <div class="col border" style="background-color: white;">
              Evidence #2: LGBTQ youth report experiencing more bullying than their non-LGBTQ peers. According to data from the nationally representative Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, 18.8% of heterosexual students reported being bullied at school in comparison with 34.2% of LGB students from 2014 to 2015.26 …However, emerging evidence suggests that stigma-based bullying, including bullying that is motivated by actual or perceived sexual orientation, is associated with worse health outcomes than non-stigma–based bullying. Moreover, the harmful effects of LGBTQ bullying last into adulthood.”
            </div>
            <div class="col border" style="background-color: white;">
              Explanation #2: LGBTQ youth face more bullying than their straight peers. In 2014-2015, 34.2% of LGB students were bullied at school, compared to 18.8% of heterosexual students. Stigma-based bullying that is linked to sexual orientation has worse health effects than non-stigma based bullying. Stigmas linked to sexual orientation can create a hostile atmosphere that fosters feelings of isolation and shame. These negative impacts can linger into adulthood and cause low self esteem and reduce the desire to seek help for mental health.

            <div class="col border" style="background-color: white;">
            Implications for effective “solutions:" Implement and enforce anti-discrimination policies that purposefully protect LGBTQ+ individuals seeking medical care and to improve medical services/facilities
